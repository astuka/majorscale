# majorscale


hi

i don't know what im doing

hence why this project exist

majorscale is a silly little website dedicated towards reviewing majors on three different characteristics

its REAL meaning is to help me practice webdev skills as well as get used to doing the whole github thing

this is probably very boring to most people. sorry!
